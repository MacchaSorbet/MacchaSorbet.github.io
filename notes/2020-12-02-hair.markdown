Hair has come a long way in SecondLife since I last had any. My previous hair was custom made and looked awesome...back then.
I had two sets. One long and one short. Sparky customized it for me, and I looked great!

But with this new avatar, all mesh and bento and bom (I haven't figured out what that last one is yet), I feel its time for something new. After a few days of shopping around though I came to realize that it's going to be harder than I expected. There is so much choice! And what kind of hair would suit this new head of mine?

I have always wanted long flowing pigtails. But I tend to cut my hair shoulder length to avoid clogging the drain. In SecondLife though, if the drain gets clogged, you can just reset it! So I bought some fine, flowing and customizable hair from SELLER SHOP NAME.

Attaching the hair is a pain in the ass. For humans, they just wear the stuff. But for us, regular folk, its a little more complex. And no girl wants to be seen without her head on in public. But the time it takes to detach your head, attach some luscious locks to it and finally re-attach sure is worth the effort! At last, my new body is ready for Christmas!

After Christmas though, I'm gonna need a new wardrobe.
