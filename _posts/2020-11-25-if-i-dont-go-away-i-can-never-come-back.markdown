Long ago, in a sim far far away, I used to run a thriving business in SecondLife. Every day I would log in and sit at my desk, in an office I created, and take orders from anyone who needed something building, scripting, an extra bunny for a photo shoot, or an extra member of staff for a spanking sim (one time, I swear!). Ah....good times.

My friends, and second family, were all there to liven up those dull days. And I would often start building with no idea what the end result was going to be.

I made enough money in SecondLife to convert into GBP and buy a plane ticket to Tokyo. Some people made more than that. Amazing!

But, alas, due to some health issues, a new job and a move to another country, I had to say goodbye to SecondLife for a short while. And that short while became a long while. Maybe 10 years!

It took so long to get healthy again, get settled in, and finally save enough money for a decent computer. But that is what I did, and now the time has finally come! Maccha Returns!

My return, however, was not met with fanfair. No fireworks (except some I found on a re-creation of Brighton Pier). No influx of missed messages from long lost friends, well wishers or stalkers! Not an electronic sausage!

In fact...almost everyone I knew back then has moved on. Places I used to frequent have vanished. SecondLife is far less popular. And so much has changed.

My once perfectly pink body now looked saggy and kind of blocky. Compared to other residents, my clothes looked pathetic, and my feet! Don't get my started on me feet!

Luckily, after vising a few places I received my first "welcome back" message from an old friend. At least someone was still logging in and happy to see me! Also happy to help me out with this new Bento thing. With a little help from him, I was soon able to upgrade my body to something far less embarrasing. Even got to keep my custom skin!

And, bless him, he bought me a new Christmas dress to replace my old fashioned one.

There is still a lot to do, and people to meet. But every great journey begins with the click of a "sign in" button. And if all goes well, I'll be able to stick around until Linden Labs decides to shut down.
