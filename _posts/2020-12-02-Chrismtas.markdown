I love Christmas! Even though I'm not affiliated with any specific religion I can appreciate the spirit and wonder of it all. But for a bunny from England, living in Tokyo, it's really a difficult time.

It's pretty common knowledge around the world that Japanese people will often eat KFC for Christmas. Though the specifics are usually obscured by some creative storytelling or omission of actual information in favour of a "wow!" effect. And while it is true that KFC is popular at Christmas, it's not just a regular bucket and fries! KFC do some wonderful Christmas sets. One includes a whole (un KFCified) chicken! The sets tend to come with cake and a few other bits too.

Christmas is not really a part of Japanese culture though, so its seen with less magic and family. Kids get to watch all the Christmas specials and movies but are unlikely to get the same attention from the real Santa. Many kids don't get or even expect any present, as families will often concentrate only on Christmas Cake. And if Christmas falls on a working day, then people go to work. 

For most Japanese families, New Year is more important. That's when all the TV specials show and families get together for a big party.

One thing I miss the most is Christmas Cake. For Japanese people, Christmas cake is any cake, with Santa on it. Or something similar. But the cake itself ranges from Strawberry Shortcake to cheesecake. And while it's very easy to get a german Stollen cake, or Italian Panettone here, Engish style Christmas Cake is very hard to come by. I do not know why.
Only once have I seen an advertisement for a Scottish man selling homemade brandy filled fruitcake. And the price was far more than I was willing to pay.

Christmas Pudding is also very easy to get. Yet Mince Pies are only the poor Walkers half-mince-pie-half-shortbread type.

Sometimes I wish I could open a little shop and show people here what they are missing!

Of course...that would involve me learning to bake. Something I never got the hang of. (If you want anything black and charred, I'm your bunny!)

Truth be told though, although I very much miss having a big family Christmas dinner, roast chicken, Yorkshire puds, wine and far more fruitcake than I have room for....I'll be sitting in front of the TV with a KFC Christmas set and Die Hard on DVD.

...Still with wine though.

In SecondLife though, I can enjoy all the magic and festive feelings by visiting any of the Christmas or Winter Wonderland themed sims. My previous post featured a photo taken by a fire in North Pole Sleigh Ride Adventure. A beautiful wintery sim I encourage everyone to visit!

More will be added to this post as I explore...
