Hair has come a long way in SecondLife since I last had any. My previous hair was custom made and looked awesome...back then.
I had two sets. One long and one short. Sparky customized it for me, and I looked great!

But with this new avatar, all mesh and bento and bom (I haven't figured out what that last one is yet), I feel its time for something new. After a few days of shopping around though I came to realize that it's going to be harder than I expected. There is so much choice! And what kind of hair would suit this new head of mine?

I have always wanted long flowing pigtails. But I tend to cut my hair shoulder length to avoid clogging the drain. In SecondLife though, if the drain gets clogged, you can just reset it! So I bought some fine, flowing and customizable hair from [Fabia](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/128839). There were so many colors to chose from, but I finally settled on white with pink streaks.

After Christmas though, I'm gonna need a new wardrobe.
